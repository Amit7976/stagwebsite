<div className="space-y-6">
<h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">5.3.1 Purpose of Data Collection</h5>
<p>The primary criterion for determining data retention periods is the purpose for which the data was collected. Personal data will be retained for as long as necessary to achieve the specific purposes outlined in our Privacy Policy, such as providing services, processing transactions, and maintaining user accounts.</p>

</div>
<div className="space-y-6">
<h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">5.3.3 Dispute Resolution and Enforcement of Agreements</h5>

<div className="space-y-6">
<h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">5.3.4 Security and Fraud Prevention</h5>

<div className="space-y-6">
<h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">5.4 Data Deletion and Anonymization</h4>
</div>
<div className="space-y-6">
<h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">5.4.1 Data Deletion</h5>
<p>When the retention period for personal data expires, or if you request the deletion of your data, we will securely delete or anonymize the data in accordance with our data deletion procedures. This ensures that your personal information is no longer accessible or identifiable.</p>
</div>
<div className="space-y-6">
