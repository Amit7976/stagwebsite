<h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">3.1. Job Postings</h4>
<p>JobBoost provides a platform where employers can create and publish job listings to attract qualified candidates. The job posting feature is designed to help employers reach a wide audience of job seekers who are actively looking for new opportunities. This section outlines the responsibilities of employers in creating job listings, the types of content that can be included, and the rules governing the posting of jobs.</p>
<p>
            <b className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-700">Creating Job Listings</b></p>
                  <p>When creating a job listing on JobBoost, employers must provide detailed and accurate information about the job opportunity. This includes:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
<li><b>Job Title:</b> The title should clearly reflect the role’s responsibilities and align with standard industry job titles.</li>
<li><b>Job Description:</b> The description must include the main responsibilities of the position, required qualifications, and key skills needed. It should be comprehensive enough to give potential applicants a clear understanding of what the job entails.</li>
<li><b>Job Requirements:</b> Employers must specify the educational qualifications, professional experience, and any certifications or skills necessary for the role.</li>
<li><b>Salary and Benefits:</b> While it’s not mandatory to list the salary, providing information about compensation and benefits can help attract suitable candidates. This section may include salary ranges, bonuses, health benefits, and other perks.</li>
<li><b>Company Information:</b> Employers should provide relevant details about the company, including its name, industry, and a brief overview of its mission and values. This helps job seekers assess whether they want to work for the company.</li>
                      <li><b>Job Location:</b> Employers must specify where the job is based, whether it’s a remote position, or if there are multiple locations. Clear location details help candidates determine if they can apply for the role.</li>
                      </ul>
<p>
            <b className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-700">Approval and Publication</b></p>
                  <p>Once a job listing is created, it will be reviewed by JobBoost’s team to ensure it meets our guidelines and complies with legal requirements. This review process includes:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
<li><b>Compliance Check:</b> We verify that the job listing complies with our Terms and Conditions, including non-discrimination policies and legal job advertisement standards.</li>
<li><b>Content Review:</b> We check that the content is clear, accurate, and free from misleading or deceptive information.</li>
                  <li><b>Approval Process:</b> After review, the job listing will be either approved for publication or returned to the employer for revisions. Employers will be notified of the approval status and any required changes.</li>
                  </ul>
<p>
            <b className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-700">Boosting Job Listings</b></p>
                  <p>To increase the visibility of job postings, employers have the option to use our job post boosting services. Boosting a job listing involves paying additional fees to enhance the job’s visibility through:</p>
