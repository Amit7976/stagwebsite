<h3 className="font-bold text-4xl">15. Miscellaneous</h3>
              <p>The following Miscellaneous provisions are essential to understanding the legal framework within which JobBoost operates. These provisions cover the overarching principles governing your use of our services, addressing various legal, operational, and administrative aspects. This section ensures that all parties involved have a clear understanding of their rights, responsibilities, and the operational boundaries of our services.</p>
              


<div className="space-y-6">
<h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">15.1. Entire Agreement</h4>
<p>The Entire Agreement clause is a fundamental legal principle that signifies that these Terms and Conditions represent the complete and exclusive understanding between you and JobBoost with respect to your use of our services. This clause ensures that no other agreements, whether written or oral, have any bearing on the terms of your relationship with us.</p>
<p><b>15.1.1. Comprehensive Understanding:</b> This agreement constitutes the full and final understanding of the terms under which you access and use the JobBoost platform. It includes all legal obligations, rights, and duties agreed upon by you and JobBoost. By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge that you have not relied on any promises or representations outside of what is written in this document.</p>
<p><b>15.1.2. Supersession of Prior Agreements:</b> Any previous agreements, contracts, or understandings between you and JobBoost are superseded by this current set of Terms and Conditions. This means that any prior verbal or written agreements that may have existed are no longer valid, and the terms outlined in this document take precedence.</p>
<p><b>15.1.3. No External Influences:</b> This clause also confirms that no external documents or statements will affect the terms of this agreement unless they are formally incorporated into this document through a proper amendment process. It reinforces that only the written and posted terms on our website are applicable.</p>
<p><b>15.1.4. Legal Enforceability:</b> The clause ensures that all aspects of the agreement are legally binding and enforceable. It underscores that both you and JobBoost must adhere to the terms outlined and that any disputes will be resolved based on this agreement.</p>
</div>
<div className="space-y-6">
<h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">15.2. Severability</h4>
<p>The Severability clause deals with situations where a part of the agreement is deemed unenforceable or invalid by a court of law. This legal safeguard ensures that the remaining provisions of the Terms and Conditions continue to be effective and enforceable.</p>
<p><b>15.2.1. Invalid Provisions:</b> If a court finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that specific provision will be severed from the rest of the agreement. The rest of the Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><b>15.2.2. Preserving Intent:</b> This clause ensures that the removal of a problematic provision does not undermine the overall intent of the Terms and Conditions. The remaining provisions are intended to continue operating in accordance with the original intent of the agreement.</p>
<p><b>15.2.3. Legal Compliance:</b> Severability helps maintain the agreement&#39;s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It ensures that the agreement as a whole remains valid and enforceable even if one part is struck down.</p>
<p><b>15.2.4. Replacing Invalid Terms:</b> In the case of invalid terms, JobBoost may, at its discretion, attempt to replace them with valid and enforceable terms that reflect the original intent of the agreement.</p>

<h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">15.3. Waiver</h4>
<p>The Waiver clause addresses the conditions under which JobBoost might choose to forego its rights under these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><b>15.3.1. Non-Enforcement of Terms:</b> A waiver of any specific term or condition is not a waiver of the entire agreement. If JobBoost does not enforce a particular term or condition, it does not mean we are waiving our right to enforce it in the future.</p>
<p><b>15.3.2. Implied Waivers:</b> A waiver must be explicit and cannot be implied. This means that any decision by JobBoost to overlook a breach of the Terms does not automatically apply to other breaches or future breaches.</p>
<p><b>15.3.3. Formal Waivers:</b> Any waiver must be made in writing. Informal or verbal waivers are not recognized as legally binding and do not alter the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><b>15.3.4. Preserving Rights:</b> This clause ensures that JobBoost’s rights under the Terms and Conditions are preserved even if we choose not to enforce them at a particular time.</p>
