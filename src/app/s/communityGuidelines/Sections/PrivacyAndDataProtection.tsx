            <p><b>Why Data Protection Matters</b></p>
            <p>Data protection is essential for maintaining user trust and ensuring that personal information is handled responsibly. Effective security measures prevent data breaches and protect users from potential harm.</p>
          <p><b>Examples of Data Protection Practices</b></p>
