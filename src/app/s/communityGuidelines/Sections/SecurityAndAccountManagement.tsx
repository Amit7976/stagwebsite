            <p>Ensuring Strong Passwords, Two-Factor Authentication, and Reporting Suspicious Activity</p>
            <p>Maintaining account security is crucial for protecting personal information and ensuring safe interactions on the JobBoost platform. JobBoost provides guidelines for users to follow to secure their accounts effectively and manage their information responsibly.</p>

            <h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">Strong Passwords</h5>
            <p><b>Why Strong Passwords Matter</b></p>
            <p>Strong passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your account. They prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing your personal and professional information, which could be used for malicious purposes. A strong password protects you from identity theft, data breaches, and other security threats.</p>
          <p><b>How to Create a Strong Password</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Length and Complexity:</b> A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.</li>
            <li><b>Avoid Common Passwords:</b> Do not use easily guessable passwords such as “password123” or “123456”.</li>
            <li><b>Unique Passwords:</b> Use different passwords for different accounts to ensure that a breach of one account does not compromise others.</li>
            <li><b>Password Management Tools:</b> Consider using password managers to generate and store complex passwords securely.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Examples of Strong Passwords</b></p>
            <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “S9$d@F8t1!z^A6Ln”</li>
            <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “password123”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The positive example is complex and hard to guess, while the negative example is simple and easy to crack.</p>
            </div>
<div className="space-y-6">
            <h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10"></h5>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
            <p><b>Why 2FA is Important</b></p>
            <p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. It requires two forms of verification before access is granted, which greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
          <p><b>How to Set Up 2FA</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Choose a 2FA Method:</b> Options include SMS codes, authentication apps (such as Google Authenticator or Authy), or hardware tokens.</li>
            <li><b>Follow Setup Instructions:</b> JobBoost provides step-by-step instructions to enable 2FA on your account settings page.</li>
            <li><b>Keep Backup Codes:</b> Save backup codes provided during 2FA setup in a secure location in case you lose access to your primary 2FA method.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Examples of 2FA Methods</b></p>
            <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “Enabling 2FA via Google Authenticator app and storing backup codes securely.”</li>
            <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “Not setting up 2FA and relying only on a password for account security.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The positive example uses a robust method for account protection, while the negative example neglects additional security measures.</p>

<div className="space-y-6">
            <h5 className="font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mt-10">Reporting Suspicious Activity</h5>
            <p><b>Why Reporting Suspicious Activity is Important</b></p>
            <p>Reporting suspicious activity helps JobBoost detect and respond to potential security threats. It ensures that any unauthorized access or unusual behavior is addressed promptly to protect all users.</p>
          <p><b>How to Report Suspicious Activity</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Contact Support:</b> Report suspicious activities through JobBoost’s support channels, such as email or live chat.</li>
            <li><b>Provide Details:</b> Include as much information as possible, such as the nature of the activity, any unusual account behavior, and screenshots if available.</li>
            <li><b>Follow Up:</b> Monitor your account and follow up with support if necessary.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Examples of Reporting Suspicious Activity</b></p>
            <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “Reporting an unexpected login attempt from an unknown device to JobBoost support.”</li>
            <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “Ignoring strange account behavior and not informing JobBoost.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The positive example involves taking proactive steps to secure the account, while the negative example shows neglect.</p>
