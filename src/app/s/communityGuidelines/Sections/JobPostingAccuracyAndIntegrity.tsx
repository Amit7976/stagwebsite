<div className="space-y-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">Truthfulness</h4>
            <p><b>Ensuring Job Postings Are Accurate and Honest</b></p>
            <p>At JobBoost, we are committed to creating a transparent and trustworthy job marketplace. This commitment starts with the accuracy and honesty of job postings. Every job posting should reflect the true nature of the job opportunity, ensuring that candidates have a clear understanding of the role they are applying for.</p>
          <p><b>Expectations for Truthfulness</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Accurate Job Descriptions:</b> The job title, responsibilities, qualifications, and other details must accurately represent the role. Misleading information or exaggerations that create false expectations for job seekers are not acceptable.</li>
            <li><b>Honest Job Requirements:</b> Clearly state the skills, experience, and qualifications required for the position. Do not overstate or misrepresent job requirements to attract more candidates.</li>
            <li><b>Transparent Compensation Information:</b> Provide truthful details about salary, benefits, and other forms of compensation. Candidates should have a clear understanding of what they will receive in return for their work.</li>
            <li><b>Clear Job Responsibilities:</b> Clearly outline what the job entails, including day-to-day tasks, work environment, and reporting structure. Avoid vague or ambiguous descriptions that may lead to misunderstandings.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Why Truthfulness Matters</b></p>
            <p>Truthfulness in job postings helps maintain the integrity of the job market. It ensures that candidates are not misled about job opportunities, which builds trust between JobBoost, employers, and job seekers. Misleading postings can lead to frustration and disappointment for candidates and can damage the reputation of both the employer and JobBoost.</p>
              <p><b>Examples of Truthfulness</b></p>
            <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “The position requires 3-5 years of experience in project management. The salary range for this role is ₹40,000 - ₹50,000 per month, and we offer health insurance and paid leave.”</li>
                  <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “We are looking for a candidate who can manage all types of projects with no prior experience. The salary is negotiable, but the exact amount is not specified.”</li>
                  </ul>
            <p>In the positive example, the job posting provides clear and honest information. In the negative example, the requirements and compensation are unclear and misleading.</p>

<div className="space-y-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">Legality</h4>
            <p><b>Complying with Labor Laws and Regulations</b></p>
            <p>JobBoost requires that all job postings comply with applicable labor laws and regulations. This ensures that job opportunities are legal, fair, and in line with government regulations.</p>
            <p><b>Key Legal Considerations</b></p>
            <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Adherence to Labor Laws:</b> Job postings must comply with the Indian Labor Laws, including the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.</li>
            <li><b>Equal Opportunity Employment:</b> Ensure that job postings do not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, disability, or any other protected characteristic.</li>
            <li><b>Accurate Job Classification:</b> Classify job roles correctly according to employment standards, such as full-time, part-time, contractual, or freelance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why Legality Matters</b></p>
            <p>Complying with labor laws is not only a legal requirement but also a moral obligation. It protects the rights of workers and ensures that employment practices are fair and just. By adhering to legal standards, JobBoost upholds ethical business practices and promotes a fair job market.</p>
          <p><b>Examples of Legal Compliance</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “This position is a full-time role with a 40-hour workweek. We provide health insurance and adhere to all minimum wage and labor laws.”</li>
            <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “This is a commission-only role with no guaranteed minimum pay. The work hours are flexible but could require more than 40 hours per week.”</li>
          </ul>
            <p>In the positive example, the job posting aligns with labor laws and provides clear terms. In the negative example, the role’s compensation and work hours are ambiguous and potentially illegal.</p>
            </div>
<div className="space-y-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-12">Clarity</h4>
            <p><b>Providing Detailed and Clear Job Descriptions</b></p>
            <p>Clarity in job postings helps candidates understand the role they are applying for. A well-written job description should include all relevant information about the job, ensuring that candidates know what to expect.</p>
          <p><b>Elements of a Clear Job Description</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Job Title:</b> The title should accurately reflect the role and responsibilities.</li>
            <li><b>Responsibilities:</b> List the key duties and tasks associated with the job.</li>
            <li><b>Qualifications:</b> Detail the educational and professional qualifications required.</li>
            <li><b>Compensation and Benefits:</b> Clearly state the salary, benefits, and any other perks.</li>
            <li><b>Application Process:</b> Describe how candidates can apply and what documents are needed.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Why Clarity Matters</b></p>
            <p>Clear job descriptions help candidates determine if they are a good fit for the position and help employers find suitable candidates. It reduces the risk of misunderstandings and ensures that both parties have a mutual understanding of the job requirements.</p>
          <p><b>Examples of Clarity</b></p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-10 space-y-4">
            <li><b>Positive Example:</b> “The Marketing Manager will oversee the creation and implementation of marketing strategies. Requirements include a degree in Marketing or a related field and 5 years of experience. The salary is ₹60,000 per month, with health insurance and paid leave.”</li>
            <li><b>Negative Example:</b> “Looking for someone to handle marketing tasks. Pay is negotiable.”</li>
          </ul>
            <p>The positive example provides specific details, while the negative example is vague and lacks essential information.</p>
            <p><b>Best Practices for Job Postings</b></p>
